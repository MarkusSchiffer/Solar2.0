# LAYOUTS

This directory contains the files that serve as templates for each page on this website.

`default.vue` is the template for the Home Page. The Home Page on this website is unique in that it has a different background. The home page features a styled image of the UW Life Sciences Building that fades white and becomes blurred as the user scrolls down the page. This is different than all other pages, which feature a static background. Because the Home Page has a different background than the other pages, it requires its own template document.

`secondary.vue` is the template for every page other than the Home Page.

For reference, the backgrounds of the Home Page and every other page (example given here is from the **People** page). As the user scrolls down the Home Page, the background fades white and becomes blurry.
