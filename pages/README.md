# PAGES

This directory contains all pages in the UW Solar website. Each file name corresponds to the name of the page it represents other than the Home page which is represented by `index.vue`.

## Other Details

This directory contains your Application Views and Routes.
The framework reads all the `*.vue` files inside this directory and creates the router of your application.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/routing).
