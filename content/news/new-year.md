We were proud to hold a table at Red Square on September 29th, when several students showed strong interest in our group and hopefully,many of them will become our new members in the near future!

As the new academic year begins, our UW-Solar have several exciting projects going on.

Our CEI-testbed project will procceed to installation phase which will happen on the first week of October. Three HFS residential halls, Maple Hall, Elm Hall and Alder Hall will possess total solar capacity of over 100 kW soon.

In addition, UW Solar will keep working with the Port of Seattle to help the latter develop the feasibility study for another two buildings of the Port."
