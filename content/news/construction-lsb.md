content: UW Solar is excited to announce that construction on the rooftop photovoltaic (PV) system began on Monday October 7th, 2019! This project started all the way back in January 2016 when Perkins+Will agreed to let UW Solar advise them on the construction of PV fins on the side of the Life Sciences Building and the rooftop PV array. Perkins+Will made crucial design decisions based on our advice that allow the solar install to be seemless. The rooftop solar panels will be the final piece of the multi-year collaboration. Artisan Electric was contracted to do the design and construction for the rooftop PV system. Throughout the project, UW Solar students will be allowed to visit the rooftop on select days to see the construction and ask questions. The construction is slated to finish in the first half of November. UW Solar students ask questions to the site foreman the week after all of the materials were lifted onto the rooftop.
