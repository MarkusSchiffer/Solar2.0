content: 'The University of Washington has been working on their new Sustainability Action Plan for a while now. According to the website, the plan was "built on five Guiding Principles addressing student learning outcomes, research impact, diversity equity & inclusion, responsible use of our resources, and of course, decarbonization of our energy sources. UW Solar advised the university on two parts of the plan Electrifying UW Transportation and implementing the Campus Solar Plan." UW Solar has been working on these two plans for over a year, and we are very excited to see the university make these commitments to operate more sustainably.'
