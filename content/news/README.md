## news

This directory contains all news articles found on the **News** page of the UW Solar website.

In order to add a news article, create a markdown (`.md`) file and use the following template:

```
---
title: ""
date: ""
author: ""
content: ""
image: ""
order: XXXX
---
```

Below is a table with the breakdown of what each component of the template means:

Component | Meaning
--- | ---
title | The Title of the News Post.
date | The date the News Post was created.
author | The author of the News Post.
content | The text associated with the news article. All text will be displayed as one large paragraph so if you have a longer blog post, try to split it up into several that summarize the news that you'd like to report.
image | **THE IMAGE IS OPTIONAL**. No image required for a news entry, however if you'd like to have an image go along with the news post, place the image into `static/News` and give only the file name here. Example: If you wanted to include a image called "newsarticle.png" with your news post, you would paste this image into the `static/News` folder, and then in the template you'd write `image: "newsarticle.png"`.
order | **THE ORDER NUMBER IS REQUIRED**. The order number is a means of ordering the news article. The way this number is calculated is by determining the number of days between January 1, 2012 and the date the article was written. This can be done with a quick google search. This number is critical.
