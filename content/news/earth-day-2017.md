content: "UW Solar came to the Earth Day again this year! We were, as usual, passionately talking about the benefits of solar energy and how we helped UW Campus to enhance the sustainability by installing more solar panels on different buildings.

This year, we witnessed the completion of a 105 kW solar system distributed on Alder, Elm and Maple Hall on west campus, which quadrupled the capacity to provide renewable energy to west campus residents.

One significant recognition our group got this year is the Green Husky Award, which indicates UW Solarâ€™s leadership role in improving campus sustainability."
