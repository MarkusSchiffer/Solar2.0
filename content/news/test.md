content: UW Solar made its first expedition to the Manastash Ridge Observatory, located in the remote mountains of Manastash Ridge, about 45 minutes removed from Ellensburg. The trip was primarily undertaken to learn more about the existing conditions and quantities of the materials there so that we could improve and expand upon our design for our proposed solar array. We took the trip with Oliver Fraser of the UW Astronomy Department and his students. They hope to make use of the existing solar equipment to make the Observatory grid independent and resilient.
