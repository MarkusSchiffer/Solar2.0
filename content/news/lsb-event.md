title: "Life Sciences Building PV Dedication Event"
date: "November 22, 2019"
author: "Alex Eidt & Evan Mickelson"
content: "This event was the culmination of 4 years of work by UW Solar on the Life Sciences Building project. Alex Ratcliff was at the center of this project for UW Solar, first working with the architects at Perkins+Will to make the roof of the building solar ready, and later changing the design of the south facade such that photovoltaic fins were installed rather than metal blades. The event featured Jan Whittington of UW Solar, Alex Ratcliff of UW Solar and PAE and Evan Leonard of Artisan Electric. The event started with a project summary outlining the cooperation with the contractors to integrate solar in the building. Then it moved on to recognizing all the sponsors of the project: Perkins+Will, VECA, Artisan, STF and CSF. We ended by looking forward at what UW Solar had coming up next."
