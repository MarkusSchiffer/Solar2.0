content: "On the sunny afternoon of November 14th, UW Solar visited the roofs of Maple Hall and Alder Hall with staff from HFS. Artisan Electric, our contractor of the CEI Testbed project, has already finished 99 percent of Maple and the 50 KW system of Alder is under construction. For some of us, it was the first time we could actually see what real solar panels look like and we were super excited to witness our project come to the final stage from blueprint. People from Artisan were really helpful in providing our members detailed information about the solar system and the construction process. Thanks, Artisan!"
