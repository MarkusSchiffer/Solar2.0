content: "Solar arrays on Alder, Elm and Maple Hall were one of our main focus for the past two years, and we were happy to see the project was completed at last March. From now on, UW Solar will start to look at the system performance and the research opportunities from the data stream.

The new Life Sciences Building under construction contains one really fascinating feature related to UW Solar – Building Integrated Photovoltaics for shadowing fins. This year, our group will keep providing support for this cut-edge technology to be applied on UW campus as the pioneer for all educational institutions in the U.S.

Last but not least, we are forming a campus plan for all UW buildings where solar energy might be applicable. UW Solar ‘s ultimate goal has always been making UW more sustainable by integrating renewable energy sources as much as possible!"
