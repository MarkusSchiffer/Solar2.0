content: "For 3 years now UW Sustainability, a program from University of Washington has held a Sustainable UW Festival which promotes themselves to the public mainly UW students. The festival would last a week which would consist of events such as talks, exhibitions and promotions. UW Solar was honored to be able to set up a table during the Exhibitor Fair. In amidst the dozen clubs and companies that support sustainability especially in UW, our organization made an appearance and explained fellow attendees about the projects that we ran.

Students and staff alike seemed intrigued by the efforts of UW Solar to introduce solar energy into our mini grid. With the installation of Solar panels on Mercer, the on-going installation on Maple, Alder and Elm and more future projects, we truly believe that we are able to take UW further in becoming sustainable."
