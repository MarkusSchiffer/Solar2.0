content: "CEI Testbeds. We are excited to cooperate with Housing & Food Services (HFS) again! Two years ago, we successfully installed 34kw solar panels on the roof of Mercer A. This time we are doing three buildings, Alder Hall, Elm Hall and Maple Hall. Residents on west campus, hopefully, will be able to utilize 100kw electricity from solar by May 1st!

Life Sciences Building. A brand new building on Pacific way will start to rise up during this summer for the department of life sciences. What is more facinating is that UW Solar will try to put Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) as shading lanes. We were awarded $7,500 from Campus Sustainability Fund (CSF) for feasibility study. We hope the reasearch we are doing can help administrators to make a decision for getting more solar on campus!

Port of Seattle. The first part of the project focuses on Pier 69 which is the headquarter of Port of Seattle. The feasibility study will be finished before June 1st. As a pilot project, pier 69 will be helpful for both Port of Seattle and UW Solar to explore the possibility of having more solar on other properties owned by Port of Seattle around the Seattle community."
